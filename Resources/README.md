# Top Resources for Learning MATLAB Coding

Before anything else, I have to mention that MathWorks Documentation and Forums is the GOAT resource.

**MATLAB Documentation**: https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/

**MATLAB Q&A Forum:** https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/index

In continuation, this book is handy for beginning MATLAB programming from zero:

- **Mueller, J. P., & Sizemore, J. (2021).** *MATLAB For Dummies, 2nd Edition*. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. ISBN: 9781119796886.

If you want to use MATLAB in the Engineering discipline, these books are beneficial:

- **Moore, H. (2022).** *MATLAB for Engineers* (6th ed.). Pearson Education Inc. ISBN: 9780137627981.

- **Hossain, E. (2022).** *MATLAB and Simulink Crash Course for Engineers*. Springer International Publishing. ISBN: 9783030971611.

- **Chapra, S. C. (2022).** *Applied Numerical Methods with MATLAB for Engineers and Scientists* (5th ed.). McGraw-Hill Education. ISBN: 9781260458371.

If you want to learn MATLAB with Chemical Engineering problems, this book is highly recommended:

- **Koo, Y. (2021).** *Chemical Engineering Computation with MATLAB* (2nd ed.). CRC Press. ISBN: 9780367547802.
